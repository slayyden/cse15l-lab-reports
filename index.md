Geometric algebra defines the *geometric product* between two vectors as the sum of the dot product and wedge products of the vectors. The dot product returns a scalar, but the wedge product returns an object called a bivector. A vector is a line segment, or a finite section of a line, with a specified length and orientation. A bivector is a finite secton of plane with an area and orientation. A trivector is an oriented volume. More generally, a k-vector is a k-dimensional object with an orientation and sense of magnitude.
