# Bugfixing Speedrun!
We will complete the following steps as fast as possible:
1. Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

For each step in this list, there exist a screenshot documenting it. However, multiple steps may share the same screenshot as they are part of the same command. These steps are crafted not to be practical but to maximize speed. As a result, the full optimizations will only work on your second run through of the instructions. You should be able to complete all the steps after step 3 in under 30 seconds.

## 1. Delete the existing fork.
