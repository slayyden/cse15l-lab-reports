# Bugfixing Speedrun!
We will complete the following steps as fast as possible:
1. Log into ieng6
2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

For each step in this list, there exists at least one screenshot documenting it. However, multiple steps may share the same screenshot as they are part of the same command. These steps are crafted not to be practical but to maximize speed. As a result, the full optimizations will only work on your second run through of the instructions. You should be able to complete all the steps after step 3 in under 30 seconds.

## 1. Log into ieng6
If this is your first run, type into your terminal `ssh cs15lwi23___@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replacing the underscores with the letters associated with your account. Then press `<enter>`. 

If this is not your first run, the `ssh` command should be the most recent one, so simply press `<up><enter>`.
