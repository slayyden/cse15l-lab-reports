# Researching Commands
We will be diving deep into the options of the `grep` command. 

## Counting words
By adding the `-c` option to `grep`, we can count the occurences of the desired word. 

## Case Sensitivity
Using the `-i` option will cause `grep` ignore whether a letter is upper or lower case when comparing stirngs.

## Recursion
Using the `-r` option will result in a recursive search, so `grep` will look through all subdirectories.

## Inverted Results
Using the `-L` option will instead print out the files that don't contain the string.
